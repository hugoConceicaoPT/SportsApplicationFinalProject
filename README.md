# SportsApplicationFinalProject
SportsApplicationFinalProject is a simplified clone of the Flashscore web application, built to display real-time sports scores, match details, and standings through a clean and user-friendly interface. While inspired by the core features of Flashscore, this version focuses on delivering essential functionality in a lightweight and accessible way.

The application is developed using React for the frontend and a Node.js backend with TypeScript. It integrates with the FreeSportsAPI to fetch live sports data.

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment, and a comprehensive report detailing its architecture, development process, and key design decisions is available in Portuguese.
